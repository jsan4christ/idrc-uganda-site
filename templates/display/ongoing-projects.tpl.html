<h3>ONGOING  PROJECTS </h3>
<h4>[1] PROMOTE-II</h4>
The purpose of the Prevention of Malaria and HIV Disease in Tororo (PROMOTE-II) program project is to evaluate promising interventions to reduce the burden of malaria and HIV among pregnant women and improve maternal child health through hypothesis based interventional studies. To achieve this overall goal, we are currently conducting 2 double blind randomized clinical trials (Birth Cohort 1 and 2) with and integrated immunology component to address the following 2 overarching questions: (1) Can DP given to pregnant women and children up to 2 years of age reduce the burden of malaria compared to current standard malaria prevention (SMP) strategies? (2) Will controlling malaria during pregnancy and the first years of life enhance antimalarial immunity? 
Principal Investigators are Prof Moses Kamya of Makerere University/IDRC and Drs. Diane Havlir, Grant Dorsey and Maggie Feeney of UCSF.<br />
<b><em>i) Birth Cohort 1 </em></b><br />
This randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of 300 HIV uninfected pregnant women and the children born to them, will be the first trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DP for the prevention of malaria in pregnant women. It will compare 2 dosing strategies of this novel intervention with the current standard of care of IPTp with SP in an area of high transmission intensity and widespread antifolate resistance. The study interventions will be divided into two phases. In the first phase, HIV uninfected women at 12-20 weeks gestation will be randomized in equal proportions to one of three IPTp treatment arms: 1) 3 doses of SP, 2) 3 doses of DP, or 3) monthly DP. Follow-up for the pregnant women will end approximately 6 weeks after giving birth. In the second phase of the study, all children born to mothers enrolled in the study will be followed from birth until they reach 36 months of age. Children born to mothers randomized to receive 3 doses of SP during pregnancy will receive DP every 3 months between 2-24 months of age. Children born to mothers randomized to receive 3 doses of DP or monthly DP during pregnancy will receive either DP every 3 months or monthly DP between 2-24 months of age. Children will then be followed an additional year between 24-36 months of age following the interventions. Pregnant women will undergo frequent sampling using a highly sensitive PCR assay to better define the timing and frequency of malaria infection during pregnancy and the primary outcome will be based on placental histopathology to maximize the detection of placental infection throughout pregnancy. We will test the hypothesis that IPT with DP will significantly reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy and infancy and improve the development of naturally acquired antimalarial immunity. <br />
<b><em>ii) Birth Cohort 2</em></b><br />
<p>Strategic interventions such as monthly DP for HIV-infected pregnant women and their children to prevent malaria represent an opportunity to improve both maternal and child health outcomes. This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 200 HIV-infected pregnant women living in Tororo, Uganda, an area of high malaria transmission. 128 HIV-infected pregnant women between 12 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomized to receive enhanced malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP versus monthly DP placebo. Their HIV-exposed children will receive the same prevention regimen from 2 to 24 months of age to which the mothers were randomized. All women will receive daily TS throughout the study per Uganda MOH guidelines. Children will also receive daily TS from 6 weeks to 24 months of age. TS will be considered a study drug only in infants and children beginning 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding and upon exclusion of HIV infection.  Women and their children will be followed for 36 months after delivery. This study tests the hypothesis that enhanced versus standard malaria chemoprevention in HIV-infected pregnant women and their children will reduce the incidence of malaria among children from 0 to 24 months of age. </p>

<p>This trial will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic exposure of concomitant DP and cART during pregnancy.  DP and the first-line antiretroviral efavirenz (EFV) share metabolic pathways that could potentially lead to clinically relevant drug interactions. Pregnant women will undergo intensive PK evaluations for DP and EFV during the 3rd trimester. We will compare EFV PK in women receiving DP+TS vs. pl/TS and will compare DP PK between HIV-infected women receiving EFV-based cART and  HIV-uninfected pregnant women receiving the identical regimen enrolled from Birth Cohort 1 not receiving cART.</p><br />
<b><em>iii) Immunology Project</em></b><br />
<p>The primary goals of this project are: 1. To determine whether exposure to malaria antigens in utero is associated with fetal tolerance, and whether limiting such exposure prevents the development of tolerance to malaria. We will determine whether in utero exposure is associated with tolerance, as evidenced by an expansion of functionally suppressive malaria-specific Tregs in cord blood. As a secondary analysis, we will assess whether chemoprevention during pregnancy prevents the development of tolerance. 2. To prospectively evaluate the impact of in utero antigen exposure on the natural acquisition of malaria-specific cellular immunity during early childhood. We will perform longitudinal assessments of malaria-specific T cells and immunoregulatory responses that develop following natural exposure to malaria, and relate these to in utero exposure and to the incidence of malaria during the first 3 years of life. 3. To determine whether the proportion of “tolerogenic” fetal T cells present at birth (TF:TA ratio) predicts neonatal immune tolerance to malaria antigens and the subsequent development of antimalarial immunity following postnatal exposure. We will measure the TF:TA ratio in cord blood and determine its association with regulatory and effector responses to malaria in cord blood, and with the incidence of malaria and the development of malaria-specific cellular immunity during childhood.</p>

<h4>[3] Understanding mobility and risk in SEARCH communities</h4>
<p><i>Study period:</i> June 2015 – May 2020. <i>Brief description:</i> The purpose of this 5-year study is to investigate how population mobility affects HIV transmission dynamics and HIV care cascade outcomes in eastern Africa. It leverages the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) trial (NCT# 01864603), a 6-year study in 32 communities of 10,000 persons each in Uganda and Kenya to test the effectiveness of a “treatment as prevention” strategy for reducing community HIV incidence. This study’s aims are to measure the mobility of individuals in eastern African communities, estimate the impact of mobility on HIV incidence, and estimate the impact of mobility on HIV care cascade outcomes. The study will address critical scientific gaps in how best to measure mobility and its impact on the dual goals of preventing HIV and treating those already infected. We will translate study results into tangible strategies for addressing the challenges of mobile populations, in order to optimize HIV prevention and achieve the full potential of ART.

<h4>[4] SEARCH:  Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health </h4>
<p>  <i>Study  period</i>: April 2013,  Uganda - September 2013, Kenya to 2018. <i>Brief  description:</i> Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH)  Collaboration was established in Vienna in 2010 to evaluate health and economic  outcomes of bold community based health interventions for communicable and  non-communicable diseases (NCD). The first initiative of the SEARCH  collaboration is a community cluster randomized trial in Uganda and Kenya of  widespread early community wide antiretroviral therapy (ART) vs. standard of  care, where primary endpoints will include both community health and community  economic status. An important strength of the SEARCH Collaboration is the  partnership it has built with NIH, PEPFAR, WHO, and the World Bank to draw  intellectual, financial, and policy support. From the inception the SEARCH  collaboration has worked with Uganda and Kenya government agencies, community  leaders, the US partner implementing agencies through Advisory Boards. Study  implementation will coordinate with and compliment ongoing country activities. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research  Collaboration, Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration (IDRC) and Kenya  Medical Research Institute, (KEMRI).  <i>Sponsored by:</i> The World Bank, NIAID,  PEPFAR, WHO, MOH of Kenya, Uganda; Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p>
      
    <h4>[5] SEARCH  Randomized Trial  </h4>
    <p> <i>Study  period: </i>April 2013,  Uganda &amp; September 2013, Kenya to 2018<i>.  Brief description</i>: The SEARCH study is designed to inform the current  debates on global health investments precipitated by a) mathematical models  predicting the HIV epidemic can be halted with widespread ART; and b) the  reality of diminishing resources and growing costs of existing programs. The  study is designed to leverage investments in HIV to develop sustainable systems  for other infectious and NCDs. By examining individual, household, and community  level socio-economic outcomes, the SEARCH study will assess whether an  integrated approach to addressing health problems serve as an economic  development intervention as well. Unique elements of the study a) inclusion of  diagnosis and linkage to care of multiple communicable (TB, malaria) and non-  communicable disease (hypertension, diabetes) in study design; b) improving and  building community health delivery for ART and other diseases using new and  efficient care models; c) evaluations that measure the immediate, cumulative  and downstream effects of the intervention in the health, education and  economic sectors; and d) a focus on sustainability. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration, Infectious Diseases  Research Collaboration (IDRC) and Kenya Medical Research Institute, (KEMRI). <i>Sponsored by:</i>  The World Bank, NIAID, PEPFAR, WHO, MOH of  Kenya, Uganda; Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p>

    <h4>[7] ICEMR/PRISM: The International Center of Excellence for Malaria  Research / Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance &amp; Modeling of  Malaria in Uganda</h4>
    <p> <i>Study period:</i> July 2010 to June 2017. <i>Brief description:</i> Program for  Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM)  is the dedicated East Africa International Center of Excellence for Malaria  Research. The International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR)  program, created by NIAID/NIH in July 2010, established a global network of  independent research centers in malaria-endemic settings to provide knowledge,  tools, and evidence-based strategies to support researchers working in a  variety of settings, especially within governments and healthcare institutions.  The overall strategy of the multi-project PRISM program is to apply a  comprehensive and iterative approach to malaria surveillance that will generate  an evidence base to help maximize the impact of control interventions across a  wide range of epidemiological settings<i>.

    <b><em>i) Surveillance:</em></b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cohorts:</b> The Cohorts study are three  concurrent, dynamic population-based cohorts to estimate the incidence of  malaria and other indicators of malaria morbidity in children living in three  well defined epidemiological settings of varying malaria transmission  intensities. Study participants are recruited from randomly selected households  located in our catchment areas and followed for two years.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Surveys:</b> The Surveys project conducts cross-sectional surveys in communities and primary  schools twice a year for at least 2 years in the 3 different sites.  The surveys will be timed to correspond to  the high and low malaria transmission seasons, when possible.  In the community surveys, 200 households will  be recruited from a list randomly generated from a census database at each  site.   <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Entomology:</b> The Entomology studies, propose to  estimate malaria transmission intensity, as measured by EIR, using three  different methodologies including human landing catches (the gold standard),  CDC light traps, and pyrethrum spray catches combined with exit trap  collections.  The study will be conducted  in three different study sites, Tororo, Jinja, and Kanungu, all of which were  included in the original survey conducted in Uganda.</p>
    <p><b><em>ii) Parasite and Insecticide Resistance:</em></b> The Resistance project will utilize available tools to conduct efficient  surveys of the prevalence of known resistance markers across Uganda, develop  new tools to improve surveillance methods, search for new markers to allow us  to track the development of resistance to newer drugs and insecticides and  identify associations between specific interventions and the development of  resistance. </p>
    <p><b><em>iii) Immunology: </em></b>The Immunology  Project, in response to the need for better tools to measure exposure and the  relationship between exposure and disease, the specific aims of the Immunology  Project are: 1) to characterize the individual-level relationships between P.  falciparum exposure, the immune response, and protection from infection and  disease in Ugandan cohorts, 2) to develop and validate immunologic assays for  estimating the population-level dynamics of exposure to P. falciparum in  surveillance studies performed throughout Uganda, and 3) to develop and  validate immunologic assays for estimating the population-level dynamics of  disease in response to changing P. falciparum exposure in surveillance studies  performed throughout Uganda.</p>

        <h4>[10] Acceptability  and feasibility of serial HIV testing during pregnancy and the postpartum  period with male partner testing in Tororo, Uganda</h4>
    <p><i>Study Period: </i>February 2013 to March 2016. <i>Brief Description:</i> Recognizing that  perinatal transmission of HIV continues to be a critical public health crisis,  the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) declared a country-led  multinational goal to eliminate perinatal HIV infections and to improve  maternal HIV care by 2015. In order to assess the acceptability and feasibility  of serial HIV testing, HIV-negative pregnant women were asked to participate in  repeat HIV tests integrated into routine follow up antenatal and postpartum  child immunization visits. While women reported high interest in involving  their male partners in HIV testing and testing was offered free of charge,  actual uptake of HIV testing among men was very low.  Innovative strategies to successfully  integrate male partner testing within routine antenatal and postpartum health services  as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in sub-Saharan Africa needs  to be piloted and studied. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration.  <i>Sponsored by:  </i>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National  Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD/NIH) </p>
