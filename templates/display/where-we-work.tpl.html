  <h3>Kampala </h3>
  <p> The headquarters of IDRC are located at Mulago Hospital complex and houses Finance and Administration, Regulatory department, Data Center and the Molecular laboratory. The Molecular laboratory serves all of our clinical projects in Uganda by providing confirmatory expert malaria microscopy for studies in Kampala and at our field sites and performing related molecular studies.</p>
    
    <h3><br>Tororo </h3>
    <p>The Tororo Research Clinic started in 2007 with Tororo Child Cohort (TCC) study, which was aimed at studying interactions between HIV and Malaria. The facility also runs HIV and malaria trials aimed at evaluating methods to prevent malaria in children and pregnant women. The Tororo research clinic  houses the state of the art immunology and parasitology research laboratories and a data center.</p>
    
   <h3><br> Mbarara site</h3>
   <p> The Mbarara office was opened early 2011 to host the SEARCH (Sustainable East African Research for Community Health) pilot studies. The SEARCH collaboration was established to conduct community based research with global partners in health, economics and education that catalyses movement to the Millennium Development Goals. The Mbarara office also hosts the EARLI and STARTs studies.</p>
    
    <h3><br>Mbale site</h3>
    <p>The Mbale site was opened in June 2013 as a second SEARCH site. </p>
    
    <h3><br>Kihihi site</h3> 
   	<p> Kihihi site is located at Kihihi Health Center IV, which is the largest public health facility serving Kihihi sub-county in Kanungu district in southwestern Uganda. Kihihi sub-county is a rural area with relatively low malaria transmission intensity. The site is also well equipped with participant consultation rooms for cohort study participants, laboratory for malaria microscopy and blood sample processing for immunology studies, and mosquito sample collection/processing for entomology studies. Main activities at this site include a cohort  study to estimate incidence of malaria, entomology studies to measure malaria transmission, and cross-sectional surveys to estimate prevalence of malaria </p>
    
    <h3><br> Nagongera site</h3> 
    <p>Nagongera site is located at Nagongera Health Center IV, which serves Nagongera sub-county in Tororo district in eastern Uganda. Nagongera sub-county is predominantly a rural setting with very high malaria transmission. Just like Kihihi site, the site is also well equipped with participant consultation rooms for cohort study participants, laboratory for malaria microscopy and blood sample collection/processing for immunology studies, and mosquito sample collection/processing for entomology studies. Activities at this site include a cohort study to estimate incidence of malaria, entomology studies to measure malaria transmission, and cross-sectional surveys to estimate prevalence of malaria. </p>
    
    <h3><br> Walukuba site</h3>
    <p> Walukuba site is located at Walukuba Health Center IV, which serves Walukuba sub-county in Jinja district in eastern Uganda. Walukuba sub-county is peri-urban with medium malaria transmission intensity. The site is well equipped with participant consultation rooms for cohort study participants, laboratory for malaria microscopy and blood sample processing for immunology studies, and mosquito sample collection/processing for entomology studies. Activities at this site include: cohort study to estimate incidence of malaria, entomology studies to measure malaria transmission, and cross-sectional surveys to estimate prevalence of malaria</p>
     
     <h3><br>Sentinel sites for malaria surveillance</h3> 
     <p>The Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project (UMSP) was formed in 2001 and is administered by IDRC. The purpose of forming UMSP was to establish and implement a multi-site surveillance system in Uganda for the evaluation of malaria-associated morbidity and mortality and the efficacy and safety of available antimalarial therapies, and to build local capacity with the goal of providing sustainable progress in malaria control. UMSPâ€™s surveillance system is based in six districts, including Apac, Kanungu, Kabale, Tororo, Mubende and Jinja. Out-patient surveillance is conducted at representative Health Centre IVs located in each district (Aduku, Kihihi, Kamwezi, Nagongera, Kasambya and Walukuba HC IVs) while in-patient surveillance is conducted in the pediatric wards of select public hospitals, located in the same districts.
